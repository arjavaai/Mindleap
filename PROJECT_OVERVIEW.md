### Architecture Components:

#### **Frontend Stack**
- **React 18**: Modern UI library with hooks and concurrent features
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development with enhanced IDE support
- **React Router DOM**: Client-side routing for SPA navigation
- **Vite**: Lightning-fast build tool with HMR support

#### **Styling & Animation**
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- **Framer Motion**: Production-ready animation library
- **Shadcn/UI**: High-quality, accessible component library
